# DC-Fan
DigTek Project for the course 1TE717 Digitalteknik och Elektronink 

### Abstract  
This project presents a temperature-regulated DC fan control system using an Arduino. The system allows users to set a target temperature between 18°C and 28°C via a potentiometer, while a temperature sensor monitors the actual room temperature. A cooling mechanism, controlled by a transistor and pulse-width modulation (PWM), adjusts the fan speed based on the temperature difference. A simple LED interface provides visual feedback on system status. The design integrates four subsystems—temperature setpoint, sensor, cooling, and interface—tested individually and assembled into a functional prototype. The system successfully regulates temperature by dynamically controlling fan speed.
